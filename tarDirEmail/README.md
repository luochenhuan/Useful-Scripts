### tarDirEmail.sh
The initiative to this shell script is that I audit a undergraduate course and need my friend to send the course materials under her account to me.
#### Instruction:
- Modify `dir` to be the path of target directory;Better use relative path, or `tar` command will give warning

- Modify `dir` to be the email address of recipient;

- If want to exclude any file or folder, modify `excld`, but **no slash** in the end; and if there is more than one file or folder to exclude, this script won't support.
